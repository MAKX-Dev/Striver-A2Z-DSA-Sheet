# Striver A2Z DSA Sheet (C++ Solutions)

This repository contains my solutions to the **Striver A2Z DSA Course + Sheet** problems in C++.  
The A2Z roadmap is designed to build fundamentals from scratch and gradually progress towards advanced Data Structures & Algorithms.

## 📌 About
- Problems are solved in **C++**, organized topic-wise.  
- Progress is tracked using the **official A2Z tracker on TakeUForward (TUF)**.  
- Repo shows my coding journey step by step (from basics → advanced).

##  How I Work
1. Watch Striver’s **A2Z lecture** for theory.  
2. Solve problem from the sheet in VS Code.  
3. If stuck → check editorials/blogs → update **notes/error book**.  
4. Re-attempt problem until solved independently.  
5. Push solution to this repo.
